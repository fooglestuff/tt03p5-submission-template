# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Based on the CDP1802 core I developed for TMBoC, but with a different memory interface to make it use Q-SPI ROM and RAM chips. Tested with W25Q128 ROM. Supported RAM component is LY68L6400.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Wire up a W25QXX(X) ROM as indicated by the pinout, and pre-load it with the assembled example program in the README. It should blink the Q output.
